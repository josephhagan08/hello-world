My first Github repository

Greetings!
As you can tell from the description, this is my first Github repository. 
I'm a part-time student, working full-time, and live in the UK.
As part of my degree we've had to dabble in C and I found I enjoyed it as it added a new dimension to my skillset.
So far I've played around with C, Python and Java, but I'm not very proficient in any of them yet.
My goal is to be comfortable in at least one of the above languages (probably C because of its usefulness to me as an engineer,
but no doubt my outlook on this will change the more I learn) by the end of the year (2018).
